# netflix-stocks
Capstone project for Codecademy skill path "Visualize Data with Python".

The two main files of this project are:
- netflix_visualizations.ipynb
Which is the Codecademy-provided Jupyter notebook, but with my answers added in.
- Slides/Slides.pdf
Which is 100% my presentation about what I found out about the 2017 Netflix stock data.
